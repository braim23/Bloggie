# Bloggie
A mini blog post webiste. The admin's got a CRUD functionality for blog posts, tags and users. A signed in user can view the blog posts and comment onto them, whereas a non-signed-in user can only view the blog posts and comments without commenting.

## How to run
- Just update the database and OnModelCreating will seed you a super admin user with the following credentials:
`superadmin@bloggie.com`, `1q2w3E*`.
